[Jakub](https://twitter.com/JakubPilimon) is a Developer Advocate at [VMware](https://vmware.com), blogger, programmer, and trainer. He loves to tackle complex enterprises with Domain-Driven Design, Test-Driven Development and Spring. Architecture is a main area of interest, too. When he doesn't program, he rides motorbikes, skis or practices kitesurfing.

He writes a [DZone MVB awarded blog](https://pillopl.github.io) and his pet projects can be found at [https://github.com/ddd-by-examples](https://github.com/ddd-by-examples).
